# Collaboration Guidelines for New Developers

Welcome to the Flow Test Generator Chrome Extension repository! We are excited to have you on board. To ensure a smooth and efficient workflow, please follow these best practices when contributing to the project.

## Branch Naming Pattern

When creating a new branch, use the following naming pattern:

- **devinitials**: Your initials (two letters).
- **branch-name**: A descriptive name for the branch.

### Examples

- `js/feature-login`
- `ab/bugfix-header`

## Pull Request Guidelines

- **Create a Branch**: Always create a new branch for your work. Do not commit directly to the main branch.
- **Descriptive Branch Names**: Use descriptive names for your branches following the branch naming pattern.
- **Commit Messages**: Write clear and concise commit messages. Each message should describe the purpose of the commit.
- **Pull Request Title**: Use a descriptive title for your pull request. It should summarize the changes you have made.
- **Pull Request Description**: Provide a detailed description of your changes. Include any relevant information, such as:
  - The purpose of the changes.
  - Any dependencies or prerequisites.
  - How to test the changes.
- **Code Review**: Request a code review from at least one other developer. Address any feedback or comments before merging.
- **Testing**: Ensure that your changes are thoroughly tested. Include unit tests where applicable.
- **Documentation**: Update any relevant documentation to reflect your changes.

## Code Style and Best Practices

- **Consistency**: Follow the existing code style and conventions used in the repository.
- **Readability**: Write clean and readable code. Use meaningful variable and function names.
- **Comments**: Add comments to explain complex logic or important sections of the code.
- **Avoid Large Commits**: Break your changes into smaller, manageable commits. This makes it easier to review and understand the changes.
- **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Ensure that any new dependencies are added to the appropriate configuration files (e.g., `package.json`).

## Communication

- **Be Respectful**: Treat your fellow developers with respect. Provide constructive feedback and be open to receiving it.
- **Ask for Help**: If you are unsure about something, don't hesitate to ask for help. Use the project's communication channels to seek assistance.
- **Stay Informed**: Keep up to date with the project's progress and any important announcements. Participate in team meetings and discussions.

## Conclusion

By following these best practices, we can maintain a high standard of quality and ensure a smooth workflow for everyone involved. Thank you for your contributions, and happy coding!
